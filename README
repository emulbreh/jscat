jscat is cat for javascript files.

It was written as a replacement for the 'require' feature of the sprocketize script that used to be a part of sprockets [1]. 
You may specify dependencies for your javascript files relative to files:

    //= require "dependency.js"

or relative to include paths that are configured with the -I commandline option:

    //= require <external-dependency.js>
